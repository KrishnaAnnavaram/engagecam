# The writing standard: ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English

Use these rules for every README and for `docs/ste-style-guide.md` in each repository. Copy this file
into the repository as `docs/ste-style-guide.md` and add a **project vocabulary** section (Section 3)
with the technical names and technical verbs of that project.

## 1. The writing rules

### Words

1. Use one word for one meaning, and one meaning for one word. Do not use synonyms for variety.
2. Use a word only as one part of speech. For example, `test` is a noun or a verb, `check` is a verb.
3. Do not use phrasal verbs (`set up`, `carry out`, `find out`, `pick up`, `look up`, `come up with`).
   Use one verb: `prepare`, `do`, `find`, `get`, `make`.
4. Do not use an `-ing` form as a noun or an adjective (`the running job`, `after indexing`).
   Exception: a technical name, a file name, a command or a status value.
5. Do not use contractions (`don't`, `it's`, `can't`). Do not use slang or idioms
   (`out of the box`, `under the hood`, `at a glance`, `gotcha`, `bells and whistles`).
6. Do not use `and/or`. Write `A, B or both`.
7. Do not use `should`, `could`, `would` or `may` for instructions. Use `must` for a rule, the
   imperative for a step and `can` for a possibility.
8. Keep the articles `a`, `an` and `the` in sentences.
9. Do not make a noun cluster of more than three words. A technical name is one word.

### Sentences

1. A procedural sentence (an instruction) has a maximum of **20 words**.
2. A descriptive sentence has a maximum of **25 words**.
3. Write one instruction in one sentence.
4. Use the imperative for an instruction: `Run the tests.` Not `The tests should be run.`
5. Use the active voice. Use the passive voice only when the agent of the action is not important.
6. Use only the simple present, the simple past and the simple future.
7. Put a condition before the instruction: `If the index is stale, build it again.`
8. Do not use semicolons in sentences. Write two sentences.

### Paragraphs, notes and warnings

1. A paragraph has one topic and a maximum of **6 sentences**. Start with the topic sentence.
2. A warning or a caution starts with a clear command. Then it gives the reason.
3. A note gives information. It does not give an instruction.
4. Use a vertical list for a sequence or a set of conditions. Each item of a numbered procedure is one step.

### Tables, headings and diagrams

1. A table cell can be a short phrase. If a cell has a sentence, the sentence obeys the rules.
2. A heading is a noun phrase (`The cost model`) or an imperative (`Run the demo`).
   Do not start a heading with an `-ing` form.
3. A diagram label is a short phrase. Use the same terms as the text.

### What STE does not change

Code, commands, file names, paths, field names, environment variables, status values, enum values,
product names and URLs stay exactly as they are. They are technical names. Put them in backticks.

## 2. General words to replace

| Do not use | Use |
|---|---|
| utilize, leverage | use |
| in order to | to |
| set up | prepare, install, configure |
| carry out, perform | do |
| make sure, ensure | make sure (allowed), or `check that` |
| a lot of, lots of | many, much |
| e.g., i.e. | for example, that is |
| should (instruction) | must (rule) / imperative (step) |
| might, may (possibility) | can |
| very, really, just, simply, easily | (delete) |
| seamless, robust, powerful, blazing | (delete or give a measured fact) |

## 3. Project vocabulary

This section gives the technical names and the technical verbs of engagecam. The README uses each term with only this meaning.

### 3.1 Technical names (nouns)

| Term | Meaning | Do not use |
|---|---|---|
| **state** | One of the 7 engagement and affect states in `states.STATES` | class, emotion, label (for the state itself) |
| **frame** | One face image from a video | picture, sample, image (for a video frame) |
| **clip** | One video segment, named by `clip_id`. Its frames have one state | video (for one segment), sequence |
| **subject** | One person, named by `subject_id` | user, participant, learner (in tables) |
| **source** | The data set of a frame: `daisee`, `yawdd`, `src_a`, `src_b` | dataset (for one row), origin |
| **manifest** | The CSV with one row for each frame | index file, metadata (alone) |
| **split** | `train`, `val` or `test` | fold, partition |
| **subject-disjoint split** | A split where each subject is in one part only | grouped split (alone), clean split |
| **frame split** | A random split of frames. It leaks subjects | random split (alone) |
| **input spec** | The size and the scaling that one model expects | config (alone), preprocessing settings |
| **baseline** | A scikit-learn pipeline on pixels or HOG features | classical model, simple model |
| **source probe** | A classifier that predicts the source from the model features | domain classifier |
| **engagement index** | The weighted sum of state probabilities, from 0 to 1 | engagement score, attention score |
| **synthetic data** | Data that `synthetic.py` draws | fake data, dummy data |

### 3.2 Technical verbs

| Verb | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **crop** | Cut the face region from a frame |
| **preprocess** | Crop, resize and scale a frame with the input spec |
| **split** | Divide the manifest into `train`, `val` and `test` |
| **oversample** | Copy training frames of rare states until each state has the majority count |
| **probe** | Measure if the features can predict the source |
| **aggregate** | Average the frame probabilities of one clip |
